### The main difficulties occurred during teamwork:
1. Organization of teamwork: to structure tasks, allocate responsibilities and deadlines, eliminate duplication, minimize conflicts by code. With a competent approach and the use of modern tools / techniques - it is solved quickly and effectively
2. Application of CMS Contentful, GraphQL, I18next framework. The study of issues of connection, organization of interaction, including on GatsbyJS
