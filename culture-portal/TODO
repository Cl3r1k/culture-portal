Todo:

  Indicative algorithm for a group work:
    ✔ Start a group chat with participants; @done(20-02-16 18:59)
    ✔ Discuss which strong points every member of the team has; @done(20-02-16 18:59)
    ✔ Split the major task into small subtasks. Each couple hours long; @done(20-02-16 18:59)
    ☐ Document them;
    ✔ You can use resourсes for team work such as trello.com / GitHub Projects / Google Sheets (Example  of [template](`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c8OGxkATLMkBhEXW9xSsxWXg6B6r0-_CKZeEMoKFqGI/edit#gid=0`)); @done(20-02-16 18:59)
    ✔ Someone has to make primary structure of the project where the rest will do their PRs later; @done(20-02-16 18:59)
    ✔ Collaboration will be carried out using Pull Requests. Everyone must merge PRs by him/herself; @done(20-02-16 18:59)
    ☐ You will need to take into account the time required for improvements or corrections before the deadline, because something might go wrong;
    ☐ Students may involve their mentors, if mentors don't mind;

    ## Technical requirements
    The portal must contain the following components / functional parts / blocks:
    
    Pages:
    ☐ Main page with
      ☐ portal's description
      ☐ 'author of the day' block
      ☐ developer team description (userpics + github accounts + nicknames/names), and contribution of each member
    ☐ Navigation
    ☐ Page with a list of authors on the given topic with search widget
      ☐ Search should be on the current language with ability to search by name, city/place of birth
      ☐ **7-12** authors are enough to complete the task successfully. You can take more, if you have enough time and willingness
    ☐ Page of an author with
      ☐ Author's name
      ☐ Years of life
      ☐ Her/his picture
      ☐ Biography in the form of timeline
        - (example [here](`https://reactjsexample.com/a-vertical-timeline-component-for-react/`))
        - (example [here](`https://github.com/veysiyildiz/vertical-timeline-component-for-react/`))
      ☐ List of artist's works with the date of creation
      ☐ Photo gallery with author's picture and pictures of his/her works
      ☐ Youtube video about the author / works / period of time author lived. Video must open in a new overlay (modal)
      ☐ Place of author's major activity on a map: google / openstreetmap (leaflet) / yandex
      ☐ It's okay if **not** every element (timeline, video, photo gallery, map) will be present on every page
    ✔ Page with team members with @started(20-02-17 10:29) @done(20-02-18 14:00) @lasted(1d3h31m35s)
      ✔ Avatars for each member @started(20-02-17 10:29) @done(20-02-18 14:00) @lasted(1d3h31m53s)
      ✔ Link to github / linked in / blog @started(20-02-17 10:29) @done(20-02-18 14:00) @lasted(1d3h31m52s)
      ✔ Role in the team @started(20-02-17 10:29) @done(20-02-18 14:00) @lasted(1d3h31m48s)
    ☐ Page with worklog  <========================================================= CURRENT TASK
      ☐ Table with hours and time for implementing functionality
      ☐ Main 1-3 difficulties for the team during implementation
      ☐ Self-evaluation with checkboxes and list of all requirements
    ☐ Page with styleguide
      ☐ links / buttons / inputs
      ☐ typography elements
      ☐ colors and its purpose (primary, secondary)
      ☐ icons
      ☐ the page can be deployed to other url
      
    ☐ Web portal must be deployed on Github Pages / netlify / google firebase / etc
    ☐ Web portal has to be in 3 languages - by, ru, en. Content may vary for each version but interface elements have to be translated. For this purposes you can use this library https://www.i18next.com/ or any similar;
    
    - Galleries / timelines / overlays can be found here - https://bestofjs.org/.
    
    Mobile friendly:
      ☐ Portal should be relatively correctly displayed on tablets and mobile phones.
    
    Content:
      ☐ Content for the portal (texts, facts + year for a timeline, photo for a gallery, youtube video, place of life / activity) can be taken from Wikipedia, YouTube, Google etc.
    
    Design:
      ☐ Design / appearance is **important** for this task. The text / timeline / button for video / photo gallery / search control on the page with a list of authors are important as general look and feel.
    
    The design from technical point of view should include:
      ☐ typography for the portal (h1-h6 headers, text style, 1-2 font types on the page) 
      ☐ same styles for links, buttons, 
      ☐ icon
      ☐ limited amount of colors


    Design example / UX:
      - `https://gatsby-theme-90s.netlify.com/` - theme for gatsby
      - `https://www.aia.org/aia-architects?filters=typeFilters%3A2496%3B` - grey and minimalistic 
      - `https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela-example` - white minimalistic theme
      - `https://www.humbertpoyet.com/home/restaurant` - clean design
      - `https://www.culture.go.kr/english.do` - humble design
      - `https://www.abcd-architecture.fr/` - with animation


    Technical limitations:
      ☐ You **should** develop portal using libraries of visual components such as **material-ui** or **bootstrap**.      
      ☐ You **should** use *Reactjs* or use *gatsbyjs*.      
      ☐ Such things as page content and internal data structures for timeline / search / map / photo gallery / video overlay have to be considered on your own.

    
    How to submit:
      ☐ You'll have to fill in the [the form with participants and link to github page](https://forms.gle/VSeKDMAjuCdt5gtBA) before the deadline.
      
      Team member with the lowest rating in the group that takes part in the task has to make a presentation of his/her team's project. During the presentation the following things have to be shown:      
        ☐ readme with self evaluation and worklog
        ☐ PR of all team members
        ☐ main page;
        ☐ list of authors with search field (filtering);
        ☐ author's page with photo gallery, timeline and video;
        ☐ 1-3 difficulties occurred during teamwork;

      - **-40** if there is no worklog for team
